## MonoChat
A simple chat application using the frameworks Mono (http://www.mono-project.com/) and Akka.NET (http://getakka.net/).

### Functionalities:
- Server is the chat room.
- Clients can connect to the server (chat room) with their user's name.
- Clients can see which other users are currently online.
- Clients are able to export the current chat session to their OneDrive account using OAuth (only on client side).

### Properties:
- DB: We will not use any DB. The chat messages are delivered by the server to all connected clients (broadcast). If the client wants to save the chat session, he will be able to export it to his OneDrive account (https://dev.onedrive.com/).
- There will be only one role (the user).
- For connecting to the chat there will be no authentication (only the name).
- UI: The UI will be implemented with Mono compatible libraries (Mono uses C# as programming language => desktop applications, see http://www.mono-project.com/).
- The server and also the client will be implemented with the Mono framework. As a result, the server will be able to run on a Windows or Linux OS.
